This functions identically to an Entropism (for day and night) or Elementalism (for weather conditions) Ritual, but this artifact does not consume Mind Points and the user does not need to have mastered any of the magical disciplines in question.",

Many who see the shining skull on its flip side would laugh it out as a coinsmith's prank, but old sailors would urge them to let the thing sink to the bottom of the ocean: an old legend tells of an indestructible golden coin whose bearer may command an army of ghostly pirates in exchange for their own soul...",

Only two things are certain: it's the last of its kind, and several legends suggest it can be crushed into a light powder that can resurrect a recently fallen creature.",

If the correct sequence of stances and movements are performed, the wielder may isolate a single consciousness present in the stream of souls and sever it from the flow. This is a Ritualism effect of extreme potency, made easier if the soul in question belongs to someone who recently passed, if they were of especially strong character, or if the wielder of Soulrend had a deep personal bond with them. Depending on the outcome of the Check, the soul might only be temporarily severed or even become unable to return to the spiritual stream, doomed to gradually vanish into oblivion or trapped in eternal torment.",

    description2: "Anything carried by the person becomes part of the animal form; while transformed they cannot speak, fight or use magic. The wand itself, however, can never become part of a transformed character's equipment... if you turn yourself into an animal with it, you'll have to carry the artifact in your mouth, beak, or talons!",

Once this bond is present, the wearer can use an action to inflict heavy fire damage (Core Rulebook, page 93) against one target, ignoring Immunities and Resistance. The heat of the dragon's fire is as hot as the lava of the Black Volcano, where some believe the armor was forged. Moreover, deep within that secluded volcano lies an ancient fortress, sealed by magic - perhaps the armor's true power is linked to the secrets buried inside...",

However, the transformation only lasts a few days, and each use slightly changes the drinker's personality: their emotions are twisted and absorbed by the crimson gem adorning the chalice. Only the youngest are immune to the artifact's effects, but those who yearn for the mirage of eternal youth easily fall prey to its allure.",

    description2: "Accessing these long-sealed memories is the equivalent of a Spiritism Ritual of extreme power: the gem's owner gains a Heroic Skill among those normally available to one of the Classes they have mastered.

For centuries, the lantern's power has endured, allowing the understanding of any text or glyph bathed in its light: one must only place a hand on it to see a translation appear in the shape of small dancing flames.",
    description2: "Nobody knows what fuel the lantern uses and if it is actually inextinguishable.

    description: "Well protected by its prestigious ebony case, this heavy chessboard may seem a mere collector's item, only sporting 6 pieces forged from indestructible orichalcum. However, once the owner has tied their essence to the board - using a Ritualism Ritual with individual area of effect and extreme power - they may then set each piece atop the board, which will cause it to grow into a creature ready to serve the artifact's owner.",

A door opened with this powerful artifact will lead to a spacious and majestic hall surrounded by countless doors. The hall is protected by magic and can be used as a safe resting place. While you are there, invisible servants bring delicious food and heal the wounded.",
    description2: "The only way to leave the hall is to open one of the side doors with the key itself. Doing so functions similarly to an Entropism Ritual requiring no Mind Points but with a Difficulty Level that depends on how hidden or well-known the destination is. Finally, any items left in the hall will not be found upon return.",

The wearer can use a Skill action to look at a living creature and learn everything about it: its abilities, history, and objectives - even its darkest and most embarrassing secrets will be revealed in images and words! If the creature has an NPC profile, the Game Master should show it to the PCs in its entirety.",
    description2: "However, an alien presence twists and turns within the lenses' reflections. Each use of the spectacles lets the entity extend its thoughts and ambitions into this world, searching hungrily for something - it's unclear what the creature is and what will happen when it reaches its goals.",

Time has long forgotten the names of those who prevented this from happening and some even maintain that it was the artifact itself that defied its maker.",
    description2: "Whoever wears this legendary tiara can control the minds of living beings. However, the awful truth is that the ancient deity still dwells within its jewels.

The summoned hero will remain for a number of rounds equal to the number of pages in the tome, after which they will vanish into thin air.",

It's so potent that it tears the soul away from the eternal flow, dissolving it forever. Though it may seem an ideal assassination tool, the liquid stirs and moves away from any who would not drink it consciously - which would defy the purpose.",
    description2: "Undeterred by the wine's terrible effects, some would do anything for a single drop of it: legends say that if someone lives through the agony of drinking it, they become godlike, immune to pain and unbound by the weight of emotions. But, in 500 years, no one has survived...",

    description2: "Because of its massive size, scientists believe a whole crew is needed to pilot Aion (see large size group vehicles, page 65). However, this is only a theory since, despite the joint efforts of the system’s most influential institutions and corporations, this huge machine still lies inert. Does it need a special key? Upon observation, one feels that the powered-down lights within Aion’s helm await the arrival of something... or someone.",

    description2: "Even so, it is possible to extract genetic material from it. It seems the cells can strengthen the body, though some test subjects displayed sudden and irreversible physical and behavioral mutations.

    name: "Black Gear",
    visual: "A toothed disk that absorbs all light around it.",
    description: "At first glance, this artifact appears entirely composed of shadow: the strange metal it’s made of can be safely handled only by organic beings – if it touches a machine, the gear slides inside the structure and fully subjugates it to the will of its master, whose identity and location are as of yet unknown.",
    description2: "The gear can even spread its corrupting influence to other damaged units near an already infected machine. Corrupted, non-sentient machines can only be used by the gear’s owner, while androids and robotic machinery become true soldiers ready to serve the will of its master.",

    description2: "This artifact can clone any living creature: the result is indistinguishable from the original, but it instantly liquifies into a gelatinous puddle if its Hit Points or Mind Points are reduced to 0. Unfortunately, the capsule hides a subtle mechanism: with each use, the soul of the original creature becomes fragmented as it gives life to the copy. Those who overindulge in its use will lose their identity completely.",

The process is the same as a Ritualism Ritual with medium or major potency. The user still has to negotiate a contract with the demon summoned, although cruel magic or tech could evade this restriction, forcing the demon into compliance.",
    description2: "If the demon grants their help, this artifact’s bearer gains access to a specific spell or Ritual discipline – chosen by the GM – as long as the contract’s terms are respected. They can also ask a demon to negate the entire Mind Point cost of a spell or Ritual, though this always ends the contract. Each demon can only be placed under contract once.",

When its wielder focuses their will within the hilt, it manifests a long and shining blade in which light and shadow intermingle. However, the Dyad will test the wielder: if they are found unworthy, they are drained of all energy and immediately reduced to 0 Hit Points.",
    description2: "When wielded by someone who is worthy, the Dyad becomes a rare transforming custom weapon: each form belongs to the sword Category, one deals light damage, the other dark damage.

Sooner or later, this artifact draws the attention of anyone with an affinity for magic or arcane knowledge. It holds a power as simple as it is incredible: if placed within any device connected to the soul network (see page 74) which has an attached card reader, it allows its user and their companions to enter a cyberspace “bubble” where the device’s software and hardware become a sort of dungeon; these elements can thus be influenced from within the cyber dimension.",

The information used may come from the past or the future, for the stream of souls is eternal and entwined with the very concept of time.

It is, instead, a complex force-projection system: it marks three real vertices and then a fourth imaginary one situated within a parallel dimension. Then, it nullifies the partition of space located within this tetrahedron, forcing a dimensional rift to open.

In this age of unpredictable and destructive natural phenomena, some regard that power as a source of hope and answers. Preserved in the hands of a colossal statue at the bottom of the Northern Chasm, this artifact whispers promises of control and safety, of a world where humanity will become master of land and sea.

You can rest here in complete security but, at the end of the rest, you have to roll 1d6: with a 1 or 2, the silkie makes a peculiar (often bizarre) request of you. If the request isn’t satisfied, this artifact vanishes in a puff of leaves and dew.",

    name: "Keys of the Harmonist",
    visual: "A large silver ring with nine keys of dull metal.",
    description: "This artifact dates back to the time when the Harmonists undertook long journeys across the southern plateau, spending months in service to the animal spirit that, in turn, would reveal their name and give them part of their power. Today, the plateau is an icy waste and the heavy keys that held the spirits’ favor are blackened and inert. Still, if a group of brave and honest heroes were to follow the pilgrimage’s path, showing their loyalty, that dormant power might be reawakened and the spirits could fight alongside humans once again, in the guise of Arcana that can be summoned by any member of the group (but not by two or more at once).",

    name: "Moon Mirror",
    visual: "A circular mirror of oxidized metal.",
    description: "Found by one of the village’s founders in a very ancient tomb near the ocean, this mirror appears to be made out of an unknown metal which reflects moonlight with great intensity. At night, it allows the user to perform a Ritual as if they had acquired the Verdant Sway Skill (see page 139), without paying the Mind Point cost. For this Ritual to succeed, the mirror must be oriented to reflect moonlight toward the plant. Sometimes, the reflected light causes vibrations and unpredictable movements in machines and armor. What is its secret?",

    name: "Reidy’s Journal",
    visual: "An old journal with thick pages, overflowing with notes.",
    description: "Written by a young and brilliant scholar during his final days, this massive journal is a rich anthology of legends, folklore and historical accounts.",
    description2: "Once per rest, the group may start a new search among its pages or continue a previous one. The Game Master assigns a Clock to each piece of research (the more obscure the information, the bigger the clock, from 4 to 10 sections) and Player Characters attempt a Group Check with DL 10 to make any progress. Once a research Clock is full, the Game Master provides a useful, reliable, and precise answer to the original question.",

    name: "Resin Tear",
    visual: "A curved sword carved from gleaming amber.",
    description: "Unable to even dent the armor of the ape-people of Iron Mountain, the warriors of Oradh Kingdom felled the Thunder Forest’s trees, from youngest to oldest, sparing none but the millennia-old yew tree near the waterfall. From its hardened resin, boiling with sorrow, an Oradhan warrior carved a blade that could command lightning (similar to an Elementalism Ritual, but costing no Mind Points). Wielding it, he exterminated the ape-people and conquered their forge, whose secrets were stolen and acted as foundation to Oradhan’s military tradition. Ever since that moment, the spirits and beasts of land and sky are at war with the Oradh. The name of that warrior was hidden, since his lineage is cursed.",

    description: "The embossed inscription on this artifact recites, in high-imperial register: “In the hands of the Winter Queen, a path opens to the new Sun”. Discovered by a young explorer lost in the underground necropolis of Abarsa, this artifact caught the attention of scholars and collectors, some drawing connections to the female statues lining the perimeter of a stone tower in the southern archipelago, dating back to the imperial age and the second ice age. A group of adventurers is organizing an expedition to the tower but, despite their protests, they have been forbidden from taking the cylinder with them.",

    description: "Stolen from the stone circle at the bottom of the valley of Three Volcanoes and brought before the Governor by an ambitious merchant, this massive fossil is under investigation by the Alchemists’ Guild, who are fascinated by its ability to emit heat and fuel flames in close proximity. During these academic investigations, however, the scholars ignored the legends about this artifact, which represent the earthly bond of the elemental spirit that protects the Three Volcanoes – if the skull isn’t returned before the coming summer, She-Who-Breaks-the-Earth will rise and, unable to find her head, will roam across the world looking for it.",

    name: "Sky Oil",

    description: "Having studied nature, the Ancients wished to rule it. Having ruled it, they wished to create it. Having created it, they wished to improve it. This mysterious liquid, which rains down from reddish clouds gathered over the ocean, is an extraordinary elemental conductor and the prime result of its creators’ boundless ambition. This artifact transforms all it touches, following inscrutable logics, compressing millennia of evolution into mere hours and subjecting the victim to atrocious pain, as the mutations observed in the aviocetae of the Coral Coast amply demonstrated.",

    name: "Three-Knot Rope",

    description: "Created in ancient times by the fishermen of the Mist Isle, these magical ropes contained the essence of the wind in their knots. Undoing the first knot, you can cast the Ventus spell (see Core Rulebook, page 189), ignoring its Mind Point cost; undoing the second knot enables you to perform an Elementalism Ritual to control the wind, ignoring its Mind Point cost; the third and final knot, rarely undone, grants an audience with the Wind Princess herself. Only one Three-Knot Rope has survived to the current day and the art of their creation was lost during the occupation of the Mist Isle, currently reduced as a domain of the Dogado.",

Even the cover is a mystery: lodged inside the wooden panel is an extraordinary clockwork device, with comet-shaped pointers moving at different speeds along a calendar, whose dates and seasons have nothing to do with ours.",
    description2: "Every self-respecting scholar dismisses this artifact as a very elaborate joke, but the most honest admit that they are a bit worried at the idea that the mechanism might stop someday.",

    description2: "Once per rest, you can put any one piece of equipment (accessory, weapon, armor or shield) in the Undoven to gain two different materials (see page 74) with a combined value equal to that of the destroyed item. What would happen if you put another artifact inside?",

During a dream, a bat told her it was stuck at the bottom of Bone Valley and that only the Vulture King could grant it back to her. Her father forbade Acaunissa from leaving, but she ignored him and sculpted a white mask with two horns to trick the souls of the departed.",
    description2: "When she met the King, he told her the mask itself was proof her inspiration had never been lost in the first place. After her return, Acaunissa’s father punished her by breaking the mask, but the artist’s courage still permeates this fragment and no undead, except Villains, may harm the one who wears it.",
